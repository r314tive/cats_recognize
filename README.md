This is a project in which i train models to recognize cats in images

In these branches I will put various implementations:

1. lr - through logistic regression
2. nn - through simple neural network
3. dnn - through deep neural network 
4. cnn - through convolutional neural network

Then, when I finish all the implementations, I will give some analysis and pros and cons of all this stuff.
